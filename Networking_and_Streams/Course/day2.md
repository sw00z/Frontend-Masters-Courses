# day 2: networking and streams

Learn about networking and node.js streams.

Streams let you glue together sources and sinks of I/O with backpressure to
produce effective data pipelines for processing data. How do streams relate to
network protocols such as TCP, HTTP, and websockets?

Join James Halliday (substack) as we dive into networking with streams. You
will:

* Use curl and netcat to send and receive network requests.
* Learn the stream types: readable, writable, transform, duplex.
* Use stream modules from npm to build streaming pipelines.
* Learn about text-based network protocols such as http, irc, and email.
* Write tcp, http, and websocket servers and clients using node.js.
* Build symmetric streaming protocols.

## schedule

* 08:30 - system check, hello
* 09:00 - TCP, UDP, and netcat
* 09:30 - text-based network protocols
* 10:00 - http servers, headers, and curl
* 11:00 - streaming interface basics
* 11:30 - basic stream modules
* 12:00 - lunch etc
* 13:00 - streaming transports galore: websockets, webrtc, p2p
* 13:30 - advanced streaming modules
* 14:00 - implementing core streams
* 15:00 - rpc, multiplexing, and symmetric protocols
* 16:00 - closing notes and wrap up

## who is this for?

This workshop is for people who want to learn more about streams in node.js and
the network protocols and fundamentals that streams sit on top of.

If you know some node.js or frontend js but want to dive deeper into how a
server and client work and how to write glue around IO, this workshop is for
you!

## prerequisites

You should have some familiarity with javascript and the command-line.
